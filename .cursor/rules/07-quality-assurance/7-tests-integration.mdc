Data Flow:
- Define input data clearly (DTOs).
- Specify expected output data.
- Verify data transformation through components.

External Dependencies:
- Mock external API calls.
- Mock external data results accurately.
- Assert external calls receive valid data.

Asynchronous Operations:
- Verify asynchronous command dispatch.
- Assert correct results are emitted.
